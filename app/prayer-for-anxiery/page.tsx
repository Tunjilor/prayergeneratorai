          Heavenly Father,
          <br />
          <br />
          I come before You with a heavy heart and a restless mind. My thoughts
          feel overwhelming, and I struggle to find peace. Please calm my spirit
          and remind me that You are in control.
          <br />
          <br />
          Help me release my worries into Your hands. Replace my fear with faith,
          my anxiety with peace, and my uncertainty with trust in You.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fill me with Your presence and guide me through this moment.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Jesus’ name, Amen.
